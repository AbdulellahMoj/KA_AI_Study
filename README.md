## 📖 Study Plan Overview

* **Stage 1** – Online Coursera Courses *(Foundations: Python, Math, Intro AI)*
* **Stage 2** – Introduction *(Core concepts, ML basics, coding practice)*
* **Stage 3** – Advanced *(Deeper AI, CNNs, Neural Nets, Applications)*

Each stage includes:

* **Preparing**: What to do before starting.
* **In-Stage Focus**: How to study during the stage.
* **Pre-Exam Day**: How to revise and test yourself.
