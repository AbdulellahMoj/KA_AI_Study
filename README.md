* Analyze **model performance and failures** using loss curves and appropriate evaluation metrics.
* Apply **data preprocessing techniques**:
  * Data cleaning, scaling, and feature selection  
  * Proper data splitting (e.g., Stratified K-Fold)
* Explore the **Machine Learning model landscape**:
  * Linear, distance-based, kernel-based, and tree-based models  
  * Model intuition, advantages, and limitations
